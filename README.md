# Prompt Engineering Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of prompts for various AI systems and use cases.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing, organizing, and sharing effective prompts across different domains including:

- **Code Generation**: Prompts for programming tasks, debugging, and code review
- **Content Creation**: Creative writing, marketing copy, and documentation
- **Analysis**: Data analysis, research, and problem-solving prompts
- **Communication**: Email templates, meeting agendas, and professional writing
- **Learning**: Educational content and study aids

## Organization

The repository is organized into categories based on prompt purpose and target AI system:

- `/prompts/` - Core prompt templates
- `/examples/` - Real-world usage examples
- `/templates/` - Reusable prompt structures
- `/archives/` - Historical or deprecated prompts

## Guidelines

### Creating New Prompts

1. **Clarity**: Prompts should be clear and specific
2. **Context**: Include relevant context and constraints
3. **Examples**: Provide example inputs and expected outputs
4. **Testing**: Test prompts with multiple AI systems when possible

### Naming Convention

- Use descriptive filenames: `code-review-best-practices.md`
- Include version numbers for iterative improvements: `v2-content-strategy.md`
- Use kebab-case for multi-word filenames

### Documentation

Each prompt should include:

- Purpose and use case
- Target AI system (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Example inputs/outputs
- Performance notes or limitations
- Last updated date

## Contributing

When adding new prompts:

1. Follow the established file structure
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Test the prompt thoroughly
4. Update this README if adding new categories

## Categories

## Best Practices

1. **Start Specific, Then Generalize**: Begin with concrete requirements, then abstract for reuse
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Test and improve prompts based on results
3. **Context is Key**: More context usually leads to better results
4. **Clear Success Criteria**: Define what success looks like
5. **Version Control**: Track changes and improvements over time
